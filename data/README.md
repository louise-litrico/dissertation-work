# Data used for the dissertation experiment # 

The root_shoot.csv and root_shoot.xls contain the same information, just in different formats. 

The moisture.xlsx contains the mean volumetric water content measures taken in the pots throughout the growth period (mean_moisture column) and the standard deviation measure associated with this mean (sd column). This file also contains the volume of water added to each pot throughout the growth period (irrigation colum), the date associated with each volume, the weight of the pots (these values were not used in the data analysis), as well as the soil type (1 for compost, 2 for compost-vermiculite, and 3 for compost-vermiculte-sand). Pots 4-6 were not included in the data analysis (see code) since they were to be used for an essential oil extraction which did not succeed. Pots number 1 were all under 50% irrigation, Pots number 2 were all under 75% irrigation, and Pots number 3 were all under 100% irrigation level.
