Each picture in this folder is one pot from the experiment. There are 18 pots even though only 9 were included in the final dataset and in the report because the other half were supposed to be used to measure essential oil contents but none were found. 
The labels in each pot make it possible to distinguish which were used and wich were not. Pots with a 4, 5 or 6 on the label are not included in the analyzed data.
